Javelin is a performance-oriented Javascript library originally developed at
Facebook. Learn more at <http://www.javelinjs.com/>.


WHAT DOES THIS FORK MEAN TO DO?

This is the next in a series of attempts to make Javelin a more usable framework.
As it stands, the lack of support for common ( and some obscure ) features, make 
it a very framework to get started with. 

In the continuing weeks, I'll  be adding all the plugins and other framework related
items to this repo, that I have been working on for the past one month. Hopefully,
this will help some others that have wanted to use this framework or were curious 
about it, but could never get it off the ground.



GETTING STARTED

Eat a hearty breakfast. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day!


WHAT IS JAVELIN?

Javelin is a compact Javascript library built around event delegation. Its
primary design goal is performance; it is consequently well-suited to projects
where performance is very important. It is not as good for smaller scale
projects where other concerns (like features or ease of development) are more
important.


PACKAGES

Packages come in two flavors: "dev" and "min". The "dev" packages are intended
for development, and have comments and debugging code. The "min" packages have
the same code, but with comments and debugging information stripped out and
symbols crushed. They are intended for use in production -- ha ha ha!
